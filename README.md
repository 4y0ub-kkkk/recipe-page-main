## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learn that start building the site with large with then moving to the mobile is a stupid idea and cost you a lot of time !!

- I leaned also how to use the property border-collapse to style the table borders !

```CSS
.nutrition table {
  width: 100%;
  text-align: left;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
```

### Continued development

In the next challenge I want to focus more about:
  - Organising the html better with sematic tags.
  - Control padding, margin better.
  - Mobile-first design.
